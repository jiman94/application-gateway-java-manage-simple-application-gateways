# Getting Started with Network - Manage Simple Application Gateway - in Java #


  Azure network sample for managing application gateways.
 
   - CREATE an application gateway for load balancing
     HTTP/HTTPS requests to backend server pools of virtual machines
 
     This application gateway serves traffic for multiple
     domain names
 
     Routing Rule 1
     Hostname 1 = None
     Backend server pool 1 = 4 virtual machines with IP addresses
     Backend server pool 1 settings = HTTP:8080
     Front end port 1 = HTTP:80
     Listener 1 = HTTP
     Routing rule 1 = HTTP listener 1 =&gt; backend server pool 1
     (round-robin load distribution)
 
   - MODIFY the application gateway - re-configure the Routing Rule 1 for SSL offload and
     add a host name, www.contoso.com
 
     Change listener 1 from HTTP to HTTPS
     Add SSL certificate to the listener
     Update front end port 1 to HTTPS:1443
     Add a host name, www.contoso.com
     Enable cookie-based affinity
 
     Modified Routing Rule 1
     Hostname 1 = www.contoso.com
     Backend server pool 1 = 4 virtual machines with IP addresses
     Backend server pool 1 settings = HTTP:8080
     Front end port 1 = HTTPS:1443
     Listener 1 = HTTPS
     Routing rule 1 = HTTPS listener 1 =&gt; backend server pool 1
     (round-robin load distribution)
